// Variables in C++ 


// so we have the following story

#include <iostream>

using namespace std; 

int main() 

{
	cout << "There once was a man named george" << endl;
	cout << "He was 35 years old!" << endl;
	cout << "He liked the name George" << endl;
	cout << "but He did not like being 35" << endl;

		return 0; 
} 


// We can store the character's name and age in a variable 


/*  <data type>  <data type name>  = <value>  */ 

string characterName = "John"; 

int characterAge; 

characterAge= 39; 


// Adding variable into print statement 

#include <iostream>

using namespace std; 

int main() 

{
	cout << "There once was a man named" << characterName << endl;
	cout << "He was " << characterAge <<  "years old!" << characterName << endl;
	cout << "He liked the name" << endl;
	cout << "but He did not like being" << characterAge << endl;

		return 0; 
} 


// you can modify the variables half way through the story by inserting the values within the places in your program
